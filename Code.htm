            <h1>Nasir Duppins</h1>
            <p id="nasirfloatleft">My name is Nasir Duppins. I am fifteen years old and I live in philadephia, pennsylvania. My favorite subject is
                science and I want to be an engineer when I grow up. The high school I currently go to is Science Leadership
                Academy Center City. My future goal is to be an engineer but I don't know what type yet. I choose to be an engineer
                because I like to do hands on activities. Some of my earliest memories involved Legos. I love building things
                and imagine myself in an engineering career. I got into the CTE engineering program at my school which will give
                me three years of specialized science coursework in preparation for college. I also got into SMASH@Wharton summer
                STEM academy which is a three years long scholarship program. Lucky for me the wave of careers in the near future
                will require professionals who have specialized in STEM!</p>
