    <h2>Kankoue Folly</h2>
  <div>  <p style="font-size: 36px">Did you know that there are cognitive advantages of being bilingual in addition to the advantages in facilitating cross cultural communication? 
        I grew up in Lome, Togo with my sister and grandmother waiting for Mom & Dad to come back for us. 
        My parents worked for nearly six years to save enough and establish themselves here in the United States and that work ethic has been instilled in my core.
         My skill in mathematics and engineering is the result of a combination of interest and hard work.
          I know that I will have to work hard and be innovative to build a career on technology that will make me a fortune so I plan to study engineering and economics. 
          Qualifying for SMASH@Wharton has helped me visualize what I need to do and how I need to do it. 
          I look forward to continuing learning with SMASH@Wharton!

        <h2>Amira Johnson</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 36px">
                    My name is Amira Johnson. I go to Smash in the Wharton location. 
                    Some things about me are that, I like to write poetry it feeds my soul. 
                    I like to stay active by doing things like sports, and ect.
                     I like to write books not just for me but for any audience, I feel that if writing a good book is a way of people feeling great then why not.
                      I like to think of myself as a serious, but ambitious person yes, I know I can be to determine,
                       but honestly people still describe me funny even though I don't see that at all.
                    I think life is something complex and you just have to work through it,
                     because even though it might be hard and seem rough you can work through and you will,
                      and you will feel really good afterwards. I wrote this quote myself it states,
                       "Don't be a product of criticism, be the outcome of uniqueness".
                        What this means to me is that instead of being what people say you are or
                         treat you as be something you think is amazing, nobody is going to tell
                          you who you are. With this type of mindset you can really do anything.

        <h2>Tamajah Deshields</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 36px">
                    When the naysayers tell me why I shouldn’t work so hard I remember this quote from author R.S. Grey: "She believed she could, so she did.". 
                    Then I get back out there with my softball team, get to the gym early for my job as basketball manager, 
                    and keep my grades up to continue in honors classes. 
                    I have a plan, please don’t call it a dream. I got into the Thomas Alva Edison High School 
                    CTE nursing program which will give me three years of specialized science course work in preparation for college.
                     I also got into SMASH@Wharton summer STEM academy which is a three years long scholarship program.
                      I am always working. This summer I have struggled to learn how to live away from home and take responsibility for myself, but I won’t give up. 
                      I will succeed and be invited to return for another summer at SMASH and I will continue with honors classes while also completing the CTE nursing
                       program so I can achieve my ambitions to be an RN and a Surgical Nurse because I believe I can, 
                    so I will.
