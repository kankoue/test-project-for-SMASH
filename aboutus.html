    <h2>Kankoue Folly</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 36px">Did you know that there are cognitive advantages of being bilingual in addition to the advantages in facilitating cross cultural communication? 
        I grew up in Lome, Togo with my sister and grandmother waiting for Mom & Dad to come back for us. 
        My parents worked for nearly six years to save enough and establish themselves here in the United States and that work ethic has been instilled in my core.
         My skill in mathematics and engineering is the result of a combination of interest and hard work.
          I know that I will have to work hard and be innovative to build a career on technology that will make me a fortune so I plan to study engineering and economics. 
          Qualifying for SMASH@Wharton has helped me visualize what I need to do and how I need to do it. 
          I look forward to continuing learning with SMASH@Wharton!
